Welcome to the Vchitect homepage. Vchitect is mainly developed by Shanghai AI Laboratory. We keep working in the field of video generation, open-sourcing the models, benchmark suites, and efficient training tools.

## 🚀 Updates

🔥 **Vchitect 2.0**

- [08/2024] We release Vchitect 2.0, including the model and the training system
  - **Model**: [Vchitect-XL]() is a high-quality video generative model with **2 billion parameters,** supporting resolutions up to 720x480 and video durations of 10-20 seconds. Besides, We are also developing a larger verison with 5 billion parameters, and will  be released in the future.
  - **System**: [LiteGen]() is a lightweight and highly efficient training framework for diffusion tasks. It supports sequence lengths of up to 1.26 million tokens using **8x NVIDIA A100 GPU cards** during the training of the [Vchitect-XL]() model.



## 🎁 Models

- 🎉 **[new]** [Vchitect-XL](): Comming soon...
- [VEnhancer](https://github.com/Vchitect/VEnhancer): A generative space-time enhancement framework that can improve the existing T2V results.



## 🚀 System

- 🎉 **[new]** [LiteGen](): A light-weight and high-efficient training framework for accelerating diffusion tasks.



## 🏔️ Bench

- 🎉 **[new]** [VBench](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench): A comprehensive benchmark suite for video generative models
