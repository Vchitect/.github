Welcome to the Vchitect homepage. Vchitect is mainly developed by Shanghai AI Laboratory. We keep working in the field of video generation, open-sourcing the models, benchmark suites, and efficient training tools.

## 🔥 Updates

**Vchitect 2.0**

- [09/2024] We release Vchitect 2.0, including the model and the training system
  - **Model**: 
    - [Vchitect-2.0](https://github.com/Vchitect/Vchitect-2.0) is a high-quality video generative model with **2 billion parameters,** supporting resolutions up to 720x480 and video durations of 10-20 seconds. Besides, We are also developing a larger verison with 5 billion parameters, and will  be released in the future.
    - [VEnhancer](https://github.com/Vchitect/VEnhancer) is a generative space-time enhancement framework. It integrates super-resolution, frame interpolation, and video refinement to elevate the video quality to **2K resolution at 24 FPS**.
  - **System**: 
    - [LiteGen](https://github.com/Vchitect/LiteGen) is a lightweight and highly efficient training framework for diffusion tasks. It supports sequence lengths of up to **1.63 million tokens** using 8x NVIDIA A100 GPU cards during the training of the [Vchitect-2.0](https://github.com/Vchitect/Vchitect-2.0) model.
  - **Benchmark**: 
    - [VBench](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench) is a comprehensive benchmark suite for video generative models, covering **28 text-to-video generation models** and **12 image-to-video generation models**.
